# Firefox port TODO

* Review code for main.js
* Indentify methods or syntax incompatibilities
* Release V0.1 of Firefox port


This is a file to track the changes required for the extension to work on Chrome, It's only here temporarily 

I will work on the first review of the code this saturday and submit a pull request when ready.

Cheers!
